1. Start server.js (node server.js)
2. Open index.html and Convert Time!

Current Progress:
Project now queries tvmaze API and if there is an available next episode for a show, outputs the date and time of next episode release to front-end
If there is no tv show found, returns error to front-end
If there is no next episode found, returns error to front-end

Future Plans:
Understand airStamp and pass it onto time converter api
Automatically make Show Time Zone (front-end) GMT
add real css for appearance.
